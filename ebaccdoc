<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The feature shared by all of the schools who had increased their English Baccalaureate (EBacc) entry rates was that they had introduced some form of ‘compulsion’ to students studying EBacc subjects at key stage 4 (KS4).</p>

<h3 id="ebacc-option-pathways">EBacc option pathways</h3>

<p>They were doing this in one of 3 ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="#making-ebacc-subjects-compulsory-for-all">making the study of EBacc subjects compulsory for all</a> (except the very lowest ability pupils)</li>
  <li><a href="#routing-pupils-into-an-ebacc-pathway">routing certain students into an EBacc pathway at key stage 4</a></li>
  <li>
<a href="#offering-free-options">allowing free choice of options</a> but strongly encouraging EBacc subject take up</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="delivery-strategies">Delivery strategies</h3>

<p>This shift to compelling more students into what was seen as a more academically rigorous set of options was being balanced with ways to increase pupil engagement, enthusiasm and achievement. Strategies for this comprised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>addressing modern foreign languages (MFL)</li>
  <li>making MFL relevant and engaging</li>
  <li>raising the quality of provision</li>
  <li>liaising with feeder schools</li>
  <li>supporting pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds</li>
  <li>supporting pupils with lower ability levels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategic-changes">Strategic changes</h3>

<p>To successfully implement this approach schools were making strategic changes to underpin this cultural shift. This involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having high aspirations</li>
  <li>getting parents on board</li>
  <li>securing staffing</li>
  <li>ensuring progression routes</li>
  <li>reflecting and developing</li>
</ul>

<p>Case studies of how these approaches looked in the schools interviewed are included.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-ebacc-pathways">Setting up EBacc pathways</h2>

<p>Schools had implemented one of three different pathways to studying EBacc subjects which had led to their increased entry levels. They had weighed up the pro’s and con’s of each approach and selected the one that best fit their school, values and ethos.</p>

<p>The pathways were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#making-ebacc-subjects-compulsory-for-all">making EBacc subjects compulsory</a></li>
  <li><a href="#routing-pupils-into-an-ebacc-pathway">routing pupils into an EBacc pathways</a></li>
  <li><a href="#offering-free-options">offering ‘free options’</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Considerations for any of these approaches include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to deal with subject dropping</li>
  <li>ensuring a broad and balanced curriculum offer</li>
  <li>time allocation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-ebacc-subjects-compulsory-for-all">Making EBacc subjects compulsory for all</h3>

<p>This approach generally involves having all of the EBacc subjects as compulsory ‘options’ to study at KS4.</p>

<p>Therefore all students study English, mathematics and science (choosing combined or individual sciences), select a modern foreign language, a humanities subject and then have between 1 and 4 additional choices.</p>

<p>Schools have other compulsory subjects including RE, PE and PHSE to fit into timetabling.</p>

<p>In a few cases students can pick more than one of the EBacc options, so for example study both geography and history, or choose to study more than one MFL.</p>

<h4 id="sandy-upper-school-example">Sandy Upper School example</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>School background:</p>

<ul>
  <li>foundation school in the East of England who were rated as inadequate by Ofsted in 2011 but improved to good by 2017</li>
  <li>increased EBacc entry rates from 9.1% in 2011 to 79.1% in 2017</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Their options booklet states: “Students joining Sandy Upper School in year 9 follow a broad and balanced curriculum having already made their option choices before the start of the year.</p>

<p>The vast majority of students follow a core curriculum of English Language, English Literature, Mathematics, Science, Humanities and a Modern Foreign Language. This group of subjects forms the English Baccalaureate.”</p>

<h3 id="routing-pupils-into-an-ebacc-pathway">Routing pupils into an EBacc pathway</h3>

<p>In this approach instead of having EBacc subjects compulsory for all students, there was a pathway of set options that includes all of the EBacc subjects (as set out above) and certain students are encouraged to follow this at KS4. Often it is pupils with the lowest ability levels in English and mathematics (and who are therefore deemed to require more input on these, or to follow a less rigorously academic pathway) who get to select a different ‘route’ or set of options (where for example they choose a MFL or a humanities subject, or have completely free choice over their non-compulsory options).</p>

<p>The decision of which pathway which students follow is agreed between teaching staff, heads of department, parents and the child. Often this was informed by KS2 assessment data and progress in KS3.</p>

<h4 id="leretraite-roman-catholic-girls-school-example">LeRetraite Roman Catholic Girls School example</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>School background:</p>

<ul>
  <li>34.7% of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds</li>
  <li>increased EBacc entry rates from 11.6% in 2011 to 66.9% in 2016</li>
  <li>progress 8 score of 0.67</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The school has set up 4 ‘routes’ of options, 2 of which include the study of all EBacc subjects (the variation being on whether students study combined or triple science). This means that their options blocks are:</p>

<p>The Core Curriculum (a group of subjects that all students must study):</p>

<ul>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>English literature</li>
  <li>mathematics</li>
  <li>science (double science)</li>
  <li>physical education (non examination)</li>
  <li>religious studies</li>
</ul>

<p>The Option Choices (from which they select 3):</p>

<ul>
  <li>one subject from:
    <ul>
      <li>French</li>
      <li>Spanish</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>one subject from:
    <ul>
      <li>history</li>
      <li>geography</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>one subject from:
    <ul>
      <li>art, craft and design (Art)</li>

<h3 id="offering-free-options">Offering free options</h3>

<p>In schools without a specific EBacc route students are given greater opportunity to select EBacc subjects by having these appear more frequently in more option blocks.</p>

<p>This type of approach is supported by clear information on what the school believes are the benefits of studying the EBacc subjects and considerations for pupils making their KS4 options. Advice is often for pupils to choose these subjects, in order to show their ability to future employers or universities.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>School background:</p>

<ul>
  <li>community school in Leeds with a fifth of pupils eligible for free school meals (FSM)</li>
  <li>increased EBacc entry rates from 21% in 2011 to 61% in 2017</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The school provide the following information to students on their website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which subjects must you study and why?</li>
</ul>

<p>English language, English literature, maths, science and PE are compulsory subjects. Personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE) is taught through the Extended Provision Programme.</p>

<p>Lawnswood School has always valued and offered a balanced curriculum that ensures students are well prepared to move on to study A levels, BTEC (level 3) and are ready for apprenticeships. We aim to future-proof students’ qualifications in line with the Government’s White Paper ‘The Importance of Teaching’ (2010), which aims to ensure that British schools have a ‘curriculum and qualifications which allow us to learn from and outpace the world’s best [education systems]’.</p>

<p>As such, the government has recognised universities’ and employers’ continued preference for people with a wide range of qualifications. Emphasis has been placed on two recently introduced measures: the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) combination of subjects and the ‘Progress 8’ measure. Increasingly, colleges, universities and employers are looking at an individual’s performance in these two areas.
The EBacc combination is achieved when a student gains a good GCSE pass in English language, maths, at least two sciences, a modern foreign language and a humanities subject (geography or history).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making your subject choices for Key Stage 4 (Years 10 and 11)</li>
</ul>

<p>We urge you to think carefully about your choices. Talk to teachers and collect further information about subjects you are considering. Particularly, find out about subjects you have not studied in KS3 before you either choose or reject them. Ask your subject teachers questions about the content of subjects and ask to see GCSE / BTEC text books and sample assessments.</p>

<p>Your choices should reflect your interests and strengths. Remember that you are unlikely to have the same teachers next year and you may well be in different classes from your friends. It is very important that you think through these choices carefully now and make the choices that are right for you, as the timetable will be designed around your choices.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-subject-dropping">How to deal with subject dropping</h3>

<p>In schools where studying EBacc subjects is compulsory for all there had initially been some resistance from some students to studying some subjects. In some cases parents also expressed this reticence. Schools were dealing with this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setting out their core offer upfront – at Year 6 open evenings the EBacc curriculum was presented as the school’s offer. There was no discussion about whether these subjects were or were not suitable for pupils; it was simply presented as what the school expects all pupils to study through to KS4. “They don’t question studying English and Maths, so why should they MFL?”</li>
  <li>having a no-drop policy – some schools categorically refused to let any pupils drop EBacc subjects. They often were concerned about setting a precedence or ‘opening the floodgates’ by allowing some students to drop subjects they found difficult or could not see the relevance of. They explained that they understand some subjects are difficult for some students, but that they should persevere.</li>
  <li>having a ‘dropping’ escalation process – other schools were making it very clear how much and why they were committed to the study of EBacc subjects. Therefore if a pupil strongly felt they did not want to take a certain subject (often MFL) then there was a process to go through which encouraged them to seriously consider dropping the subject and the implications of this.</li>
  <li>allowing subject dropping in Year 10 or 11 – when students, parents and staff were in agreement that a student was not making progress in a subject and/or the stress of trying to master a subject was having an impact on them or their progress in other EBacc subjects after they had given it a go then they were allowed to drop further study of it.</li>
  <li>ensuring a wide range of other engaging and ‘less academic’ subjects are available to ensure that students’ timetables include lessons that they enjoy for different reasons.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>increased MFL entry rates by 41.6% between 2011 to 2017</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If a child says they want to drop MFL they have a curriculum escalation process (the same as they do with behaviour management). First the child and parents have to meet with the Head of MFL, then the Curriculum Lead, then the Head. They are not forced to stick on the course, but are strongly encouraged to do so. This escalation process and the amount of staff input is to show to students and their parents the senior commitment and belief in MFL across the school. Parents appreciate the importance by being involved in these important conversations and appreciate the time and commitment the school gives to it.</p>

</div>

<p>The Head introduced MFL as a compulsory subject and all of the staff have stuck to this line. They have a rule of no dropping of any subjects, to prevent students wanting to stop studying subjects, such as MFL, that challenge them.</p>

<h3 id="ensuring-a-broad-and-balanced-curriculum-offer">Ensuring a broad and balanced curriculum offer</h3>

<p>Some schools have set up an ‘Arts’ option block or a ‘vocational’ set of options, from which students must also select at least one subject to study to GCSE, in order to ensure they follow a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>

<p>In some schools this more ‘broad and balanced curriculum offer’ is being delivered by subjects being delivered as enrichment activities or during other non-taught times.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>In terms of options this school has set it up so that all students have to do both English subjects, Maths, 2 or 3 sciences, a Humanities subject and a MFL.</p>

<p>They then select from 2 further options blocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Block 3 is all Arts subjects</li>
  <li>Block 4 is free choice, and includes a number of BTecs/vocational options</li>
</ul>

<p>Pupils also enjoy studying these less academic subjects and it ensures a broad and balanced curriculum is followed by everyone even with them studying the EBacc subjects.</p>

<h3 id="time-allocation">Time allocation</h3>

<p>There was an acknowledgement from schools that some pupils find the study of EBacc subjects difficult, and in order for them to achieve as well as possible in them they need increased amount of time devoted to the delivery of them. There were difficult decisions for schools to make in this respect, with lots of competing considerations and trade-offs to balance. Solutions included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>longer days – in order to incorporate longer lesson times and/or more time for EBacc subjects</li>
  <li>creative subjects on a ‘carousel’ rotation – allocating less time to non-EBacc subjects by having them taught for a term at a time and then swapped. In some cases these subjects were instead offered more by enrichment or after school sessions</li>
  <li>offering ‘compulsory’ RE, PE and PHSE in more creative ways – including as extra curricular activities, during tutor time or ‘intensive’ days, or within other subjects</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not provide examples of how these look in practice as there are too many considerations and knock-on effects of each of these (including pressures on students and staff) to detail in full.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-strategies-1">Delivery strategies</h2>

<p>Schools were aware that if they were advocating the study of certain subjects they had a duty to support pupils to engage with these subjects and achieve as highly in them as possible.</p>

<p>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) was the subject that schools had often put the most effort into in this respect, although the principal applied to all EBacc subjects.</p>

<p>There were common delivery strategies schools had implemented to support this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>addressing MFL pedagogy</li>
  <li>making MFL engaging and relevant</li>
  <li>raising the quality of provision</li>
  <li>liaising with feeder schools</li>
  <li>supporting pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds</li>
  <li>supporting pupils with lower ability levels</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="addressing-mfl-pedagogy">Addressing MFL pedagogy</h3>

<p>Schools had generally focused their considerations around MFL pedagogy on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increasing the amount of time given to MFL from Year 7</li>
  <li>promoting MFL, its importance and relevance</li>
  <li>making the expectation that pupils would carry on studying MFL a formality</li>
  <li>changing the proportion of target language teaching</li>
  <li>ensuring and tracking understanding and progress - with regular low stakes testing</li>
  <li>spending more time on oracy and/or working on increasing their ability to speak aloud in other areas of the curriculum .</li>
</ul>

  <li>MFL entry rates at 54.7%</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>From 2010 there was a change in curriculum, in anticipation of EBacc. They introduced compulsory MFL from Year 7, rather than the previous free choice to study a language. This instilled in pupils the importance of MFL and prepared them with skills for later in their school learning. The pupils were in this way trained to do MFL from when they first entered the school. They all get to do French or German/Spanish (this alternates annually). As they are engaged in MFL early many pupils choose to study 2 languages at KS4 (this year it was 24 out of the cohort of 32).</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>In order to prepare pupils for the type of learning they will be doing in KS4 for MFL they start embedding skills underpinning this throughout Years 7 and 8. MFL is given the significant time of 3 hours a week in KS3 to allow for this. This ensures all students have the appropriate base from which to extend their learning in KS4 and be successful in their MFL GCSEs.</p>

<p>They really promote the benefits of studying MFL through KS3. They have Options assemblies with a strong focus on MFL. They explain how languages open doors for the future, and that careers requiring MFL lead to higher pay. They explain that even if students don’t think they need MFL now they need to understand that plans can change and this allows them to keep their options open.</p>

<p>The school offer the choice of French, German or Spanish. All students choose one in KS3. This option of which language to study means they have the chance to pick the one they find most engaging. It also means students are able to continue a language they had started previously at primary school (as feeder schools offer different languages), meaning they have a better base in the language from which to develop. They then continue to study this language into KS4.</p>

</ul>

<p>The Head has a language background and the school has opted for the approach of totally immersing pupils in languages from early on. The school feels this makes their offer more engaging and motivating than just having the option of studying the one language of French. Students are split between 5 languages:
Spanish, French, German, Latin and Mandarin. 
Students are randomly allocated to studying one of these languages, unless they show a particular preference for a certain language. They originally had Latin and Mandarin just as enrichment for more able pupils, but have now widened it out as an option to all students in the top half of ability levels (as they are more challenging subjects). The school believes offering these languages is helpful for students as it puts them on a par with Grammar and Private school educated students who they will be competing with for Oxbridge entry.</p>

<p>They previously delivered 100% target language teaching.

They can access the learning being delivered in lessons and so have a better feeling of achievement, engage more in lessons and are making better progress.</p>

The basic 4 skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing are covered in every lesson, and there is a focus on progress not just vocabulary learning. Formalised strategies for teaching are complemented by wider approaches to making language more fun. For example, language repetiiton is done as a rap.</p>

<p>The new MFL curriculum has a strong focus on speaking. This is a challenge to pupils as they are shy and embarrassed about talking in front of others in a foreign language. To boost performance and overcome such concerns the school ensures it provides multiple opportunities to get children used to performing from a very early stage. They have an oracy heavy English curriculum, encourage students to talk aloud in other subjects and to study a performance subject. All of this helps to build up practice and confidence in speaking in front of people; a skill which is then transferred into their MFL classes and helps prepare them for the speaking element of assessments.</p>

<h3 id="making-mfl-relevant-and-engaging">Making MFL relevant and engaging</h3>

<p>Many schools reported that MFL was seen as the greatest challenge to encouraging pupils to study EBacc subjects, as students considered it difficult, not useful for them, and, as they struggled with it, a subject they could not achieve in and so disengaged from. Schools had deliberately taken steps to ensure MFL delivery was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant to pupils’ lives</li>
  <li>engaging and fun, although this complemented rather than replaced high quality structured teaching</li>
</ul>

<p>“It’s not all about whistles and bells and being all singing and dancing, it’s about doing the basics well and ensuring students make good progress and reflect upon that to keep them engaged and wanting to learn more.” – Head of MFL</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The school tries to make MFL relate to their pupils’ interests, enabling them to see languages not just as a taught subject but with real-life application. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Looking at examples of local ‘achievers’ and seeing how and why they need languages (e.g. local rugby player from the school who plays Internationally; the local rugby team whose players needed to learn French so they could improve their chances of being signed to a club abroad).</li>
  <li>Identifying access to films and music in other languages.</li>
  <li>Use of personal stories (“I met my Italian boyfriend in Germany and the only language we could communicate in was German”). This also strengthens links between staff and pupils, as they are interested in teachers’ ‘other lives’.</li>
  <li>Thinking about how they may need to use it in future life. For example saying “you might work in a local supermarket or restaurant, we get x number of tourists in this area, how will you communicate with them?” This helps them see foreign languages as having a purpose, and making it job specific.</li>
</ul>

<p>“We place languages into the real world. We make sure pupils don’t just think language is something that takes place in text books and we never think about it again when those books are closed. We get them to realise it envelops the whole world. We make those links to show them. We want them to realise that without languages the world is black and white, but with it your horizons are wider. We exemplify the role it plays in everyone’s life and how enriching it can be” – Head of MFL</p>

<p>The school has found sport, and its international element with players from around the world, a good way to engage boys specifically in MFL. They have lots of talks from players in local sports clubs – football, rugby, cricket – and found the Arsenal Doubles club particularly useful. This programme mixes playing football, and what pupils will already know about that, with learning languages. It can include players coming to visit the school and deliver sessions. Although this is specific to one club the resources can be used by any school, or the idea adapted for use with a different club. They offer modules on French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese. https://www.arsenaldoubleclub.co.uk.</p>

<p>The school MFL department use digital resources such as Pearson Active Teach to support GCSE students.  It contains videos which are shown to the whole class. The Culture zone is perceived as especially helpful. The class look together at people and issues raised there, for example a musician from another country who they then look up on YouTube to find out more about him and experience his work. Content is up-to-date, keeping MFL relevant to pupils’ every day lives.</p>

<p>SLT do regular learning walks, where they regularly drop in to lessons for 10 minutes to observe the approach in practice. They do more formal observations, to ensure consistency and high standards of implementation, at least 3 times a year.</p>

<p>They have staff briefings 3 mornings a week in which they share good practice, and an after school teaching and learning CPD workshop every 4 weeks.</p>

A Deputy Head oversees these meetings to ensure they remain focused and productive. He chairs and manages it as he realises it has the potential to become ‘just a talking shop’. Within these events they also run Exam Board joint sessions, moderate lesson plans and share resources.</p>

<p>The school set up subject specific CPD for teaching staff for 1 hour per week within curriculum time. It involves curriculum planning, joint planning, approaches to teaching, and standardizing work within subject departments.</p>

<p>They at first trialled the approach for English and Maths, and saw such a huge impact in pupil achievement that they rolled it out to all subjects.</p>

<p>This approach does need strong subject practitioners, so they have brought in Buddies from the wider teaching school alliance to boost this internal expertise.</p>

<p>The school does not collect data on all pupils half termly as other schools do. Instead they have decided to focus on quality data collection, not quantity. They collect from formal examinations which take place twice a year from Year 7 onwards. This gives exam performance data (which reflects the reality of how pupils will ultimately be judged, rather than lesson performance) at an individual level, and prepares students for the potential strains of the final EBacc examination period.</p>

<p>Although this leads to a period of intense marking for staff during exam periods, it reduces the amount of on-going data collection throughout the entire year as marking of work can be more formative.</p>

<p>This switch in approach has reduced daily teacher workload meaning they are more willing to offer after school interventions.</p>

<p>The Language team was restructured and Spanish was significantly reduced; now focusing predominantly on the teaching of French for the majority of pupils. This means they could increase the expertise and quality of MFL provision, as it was more focused. It also helped to reduce teacher workload as lessons can be shared across the teachers (i.e. staff plan fewer lessons, then share with each other). This also increases consistency and quality across the Department. CPD is increased as teachers support each other within lessons and can buy in more highly specialised, rather than generic, training.</p>

<h3 id="liaising-with-feeder-schools">Liaising with feeder schools</h3>

<p>Secondary schools were very aware of the impact primary school education has on their pupils’ engagement, attitude towards and ability in EBacc subjects. Some had therefore looked at working with their local feeder schools to develop an understanding between the primary and secondary school of their EBacc curriculum and delivery methods. The purpose was to smooth the transition between settings and ensure that primaries were providing a sufficient base for the secondary EBacc curriculum. This was being carried out by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information sharing about delivery of EBacc subjects, and potentially visits, between schools</li>
  <li>working together across phase to ensure preparation and progression is continual between the two schools on EBacc subjects</li>
  <li>secondary schools offering training to primary schools on approaches and delivery of particular subjects, such as MFL</li>
  <li>ensuring that their MFL options aligned with what was being provided in primary schools, for example if a local primary taught Spanish, the secondary school would make sure they offered this to students too, so they could continue with the study of a language they already had a base in</li>
  <li>ensuring they were very clear about their approach to studying EBacc subjects with potential pupils and parents at Year 6 open evenings, including details of why they felt EBacc subjects were important and their approach to delivery</li>

<h3 id="supporting-pupils-from-disadvantaged-backgrounds">Supporting pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds</h3>

<p>Schools felt that it was important to encourage pupils from disadvantaged pupils into studying EBacc subjects as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they may not have similar academic aspirations as non-disadvantaged</li>
  <li>they may have less cultural capital then non-disadvantaged peers which makes them less engaged or feel less able or as if EBacc subjects are less relevant to them</li>
  <li>providing an academic grounding would support their future social mobility</li>
</ul>

<p>Research from the Sutton Trust shows that in schools who adopt an approach to more students studying EBacc subjects “pupil premium students benefitted most …. As a result, the pupil premium gap closed a little more than in schools with similar pupil intake demographics, including a six percentage point narrowing of the EBacc gap”. https://www.suttontrust.com/research-paper/changing-the-subject/.</p>

<p>There were a number of strategies being implemented in schools to specifically support, or targeted at, pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>input to increase attainment</li>
  <li>input to develop cultural capital</li>
  <li>enrichment</li>
  <li>more engagement and aspiration building with parents</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are timetabled to be taught by the most experienced EBacc subject teachers. They are then supported and driven. They see the teacher commitment to them and respond, enjoying lessons.</p>

<p>TAs are allocated based on their skills and experience. This means Humanities subjects have specialist TAs, as does English. Part of their role is to focus on supporting pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. These pupils are identified using seating plans, which are set up so that they also get to work with positive role-model peers.</p>

<p>The school is open from 7 am to 6.45 pm. This allows pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to be supported with homework and additional learning in EBacc subjects, receiving help and access to facilities they may not have at home. This is to ensure they keep pace with their peers’ learning. A Saturday College is run for these students in years 10 and 11 ensuring they are supported with exam preparation and revision. All of the facilities a child needs for learning are provided by and within the school, to prevent any ‘gap’ between performance in EBacc subjects between disadvantaged pupils and their non-disadvantaged peers.</p>

<p>They have a dedicated Pupil Premium team and an extensive Aim Higher programme, run with local universities https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-students/services-for-schools-colleges-and-prospective-students/widening-participation as well as careers fairs and open events. This all means students from disadvantaged pupils are given as much encouragement and support to make the choice to study EBacc subjects, meaning future opportunities are open to them.</p>

<p>The school is underpinned by the ethos of equalising pupils’ starting points in life. They support the development of cultural capital in all their students, but especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. They noticed under representation in the number of disadvantaged pupils taking triple science in KS4 and interpreted this as being due to low aspiration and resulting underachievement in KS3. They therefore made these pupils the focus of teaching and learning throughout KS3, promoted exciting STEM events to them and engaged them with the practical applications of the EBacc subjects. This included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking them to Blackpool to discuss the physics of rollercoasters</li>
  <li>going to a Spanish restaurant to order and try food, and speak to a native speaker</li>
  <li>staff bringing in croissants for French lessons</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures were taken as many pupils had never been on holiday abroad, or visited other places, and so had little context for what they were learning in class.</p>

<p>MFL is linked to life, so it is not just learning for learning’s sake. They give chances to see what they’re learning about in context. Lessons are situated in context and pupils supported to build wider understanding.</p>

<p>They use football (players’ names and spoken languages) to hook children into foreign languages early on in school. 
In Year 11 all pupils on pupil premium funding get an individual coach. They develop an Individual Success Plan (ISP), check revision plans and progress, steps to success, and how to access online support, such as the GCSE pod https://www.gcsepod.com. This is to make up for the support they may not be getting at home during this critical period.</p>

<p>There were a range of approaches discussed which schools were implementing to ensure pupils with lower achievement, as well as in some cases those with SEND, were able to access and achieve in EBacc subjects.</p>

<p>This included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shifting approach to teaching and learning</li>
  <li>use of specialist LSAs</li>
  <li>provision of additional support</li>
  <li>allowing ‘opt in’ to EBacc subjects – i.e. no doors are closed to these students, their interests are supported</li>
  <li>supporting students to select a smaller number of EBacc subject options, along with time for additional input to boost achievement in these</li>

<p>Pupils with SEND are not excluded from opting to follow the EBacc options route and are likely to opt into MFL and/or Humanities.</p>

<p>MFL is often popular with them as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they start at the same learning point as all other students – everyone is starting from scratch</li>
  <li>concepts are taught from the basics and with explicit principles (they have often not had this in literacy or numeracy where there was always an assumed level of knowledge)</li>
  <li>MFL teachers are by nature specialists in differentiation and formulating creative solutions to ensuring pupils understand what is being taught</li>
  <li>due to all starting from scratch they are all in mixed ability groups. This means all can experience success and they can use peer support</li>
</ul>

<p>Seating plans are set out in order to encourage peer support (more able pupils act as expert and support lower ability. This can change daily depending on topic coverage. Pupils are skilled up in how to provide peer support).</p>

<p>Throughout the school Individual Education Plans (IEPs) are implemented and IEP specific monitoring walks are carried out. This ensures supportive practice, appropriate differentiation are being carried out in all lessons.</p>

<p>For struggling students they provide scaffolding in lessons. They produce support sheets, with prompts for learning. Questioning is directed at ability level, seating plans reflect prior attainment. They encourage higher thinking, ask closed questions, indicate time until the next question is asked.</p>

<p>SEND is not seen as a barrier to studying EBacc subjects and Options pathways are not limited by ability. Some of the cohort with SEND are also deemed gifted and talented. The only barrier to access to studying the whole range of EBacc subjects is low levels of English and Maths skills. Those students are given more literacy support instead of MFL as if they cannot understand the rules of their own language they are seen as unlikely to be able to learn or apply it to another. Teachers work closely with the SENCO on in-class strategies to support the learning of pupils with SEND. Some small group work is carried out with them in EBacc subjects, led by TAs.</p>

<p>They have moved from a generic Learning Support Assistant (LSA) model to a Department-specific LSA model. LSAs become specialists in their subjects and report directly to the subject lead. Each EBacc subject therefore has LSAs specially trained in the subject to support students who need it.</p>

<p>Those struggling with French have a former teacher as the LSA supporting them in their French lessons. They do small group and one-to-one work in lessons, are taken out of registration time for additional intensive input, and arrange oral practice sessions in other non-taught times.</p>

<p>All pupils are offered extra subject support. This is provided by interventions, smaller class sizes (to increase the level of input they receive from teaching staff), strong TA support, and teachers highly skilled in adaptation and differentiation of delivery.</p>

<p>The school runs holiday interventions, Saturday and after school sessions, all of which are subject specific. For example in the Easter holidays the school will be open every day. One day will have a geography focus where any students can attend a lecture and small targeted support work on specific aspects of the curriculum. Targetting of this additional input for Year 11 pupils is based on assessment data and mock exam results. Parents are encouraged to get their children to attend.</p>

<p>The school also timetables additional Intervention sessions. Two periods a week are set aside for an accelerated intervention programme focused on EBacc subjects. Small group interventions (for 10-12 pupils) are run, led by specialist teachers. All EBacc subjects are covered in these sessions on rotation. Pupils are invited to attend.</p>

<h2 id="strategic-changes-1">Strategic changes</h2>

<p>These practical strategies were not enough in and of themselves to support the increase of more pupils to study and achieve in EBacc subjects. At the same time as these strategies were being implemented school leaders were bringing about a cultural shift. This was across the whole school and all subjects, but it especially underpinned the success of their approach to EBacc subjects.</p>

<p>The changes brought about were:
•	Having high aspirations
•	Getting parents on board
•	Securing staffing
•	Ensuring progression routes
•	Reflecting and developing 
Having high aspirations
Schools acknowledged that EBacc subjects can be more academically challenging for some pupils. However, by encouraging pupils to take EBacc subjects they felt they were sending out the message ‘we believe in you and we believe that you have the ability to succeed at this’. Taking EBacc subjects was often linked to helping pupils achieve the best in their future – securing a good career or going to university.
Encouraging the study of EBacc subjects as part of this ‘aiming high’ approach was to: 
•	show students are academically able
•	promote higher level thinking 
•	support and show the benefit of perseverance with a difficult subject 
•	assist disadvantaged pupils’ social mobility
•	benefit the whole child and their holistic, rounded knowledge and development. 
The schools’ approach to high aspirations was: 
•	led from the top and permeated through the school, being reinforced by all teachers and in a range of lessons
•	reflected in school mottos and mission statements, and in contact with parents and the wider community
•	reinforced through the CIAG programme and focus on pupils’ future pathways
•	supported by ambitious target setting.
Examples of the high aspiration approach
Witton Park Academy
-	Blackburn school with 38.1% of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 2.9% in 2011 to 50.6% in 2016
The school considered removing French as a compulsory subject as students found it difficult to engage with. However they decided that this would be sending out the message that they do not have high expectations for their pupils. They continued to make it compulsory reinforcing it with the message that ‘we know it’s hard, but we believe in you’. They have a similar approach with encouraging students to study separate sciences.
Options pathways are explained to parents at Options Evening. The staff are clear – EBacc is for their child’s future benefit. It helps to keep their future options open. Some universities will require EBacc subject passes, and although the school cannot predict where the child will want to go it is the ‘safety first’ option. They advise pupils based on their honest belief that for most of them studying EBacc subjects will be the best option.
George Dixon Academy
-	Birmingham school with 65.3% of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 2.3% in 2011 to 72% in 2017
In 2010, following the Wolf report, they overhauled the curriculum to provide access to EBacc for all students. This called for a shift in mind-set of staff and those connected with the school. They believed that report called on schools to ignore pupils’ disadvantage and set high standards for all. Students are all expected to study EBacc subjects through to GCSE level and a third of students are now encouraged to do triple sciences. The school sees themselves as applying pressure, in terms of setting such high expectations, for a valuable purpose. 
They believe that getting students to study EBacc subjects provides stretch and challenge and allows the possibility of going to university. They explain to pupils that certain subjects are key in life and the EBacc pathway includes these. They believe that by not pushing children to study these subjects they would be continuing the disadvantage that many of them face due to their family circumstances.  The Head believes that educators have the power to change lives, and give poorer children the options to get out of that negative cycle. Studying EBacc subjects is seen as offering the bedrock for their future. They talk to all students about their future options, and how Universities will look at GCSE results when making decisions about who to accept. They reinforce how important they think it is for students to be able to show broad and wanted skills and that by taking EBacc subjects more doors will be open to them.
Denbigh School
-	Milton Keynes school rated Outstanding
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 29.1% in 2011 to 77.6% in 2016
Studying MFL is presented as part of the school, and a part of the school’s core offer. They believe in the students, and their ability to succeed, and believe in perseverance. They promote the compulsory study of a MFL subject as showing that students cannot give up on something just because they might find it difficult.
Longdendale High School
-	Community school in the North West
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 22% in 2011 to 76.4% in 2017
-	Increased Ofsted rating from Requires Improvement in 2014 to Good in 2017
They use their Inspiring IAG programme (http://www.inspiringiag.co.uk) to keep students switched on to studying EBacc subjects. The school is committed to providing high quality careers education, information, advice and guidance to every student. They have a sharp focus on careers guidance being tailored to the needs of the individual student to promote self-awareness, decision-making, employability skills, and independence whilst raising aspirations. Their aim is for all students to leave school equipped with the skills and knowledge required to support their entry into further education or employment. All young people receive a planned programme of activities to help them choose 14-19 pathways that are suitable for them and to be able to manage their careers and sustain employability throughout their lives.
Branston Community Academy
-	Rural school in Lincoln rated outstanding
-	EBacc entry rates increased from 7.1% in 2011 to 50.3% in 2016
-	42.6% achievement rate
This school encourages students into studying the EBacc subjects by highlighting the Government’s push for this. They present EBacc subjects as those that the Government says are important and thinks that all students are bright enough to study and so they support pupils to study them. The school also discuss University entrance with pupils, and the importance of having EBacc subjects to GCSE level. 
Mounts Bay Academy
-	Situated in Penzance with a fifth of students from a disadvantaged background
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 27.4% in 2011 to 76.1% in 2016
-	Rated outstanding by Ofsted
They have found the Government introduction of the EBacc helpful, as they explain to pupils that the school are not just making them do those subjects for arbitrary reasons but that the Government thinks this is the right thing for them to do, that it broadens their horizons, that Universities value EBacc subjects when looking for students to offer places to, and that it is good for the economy and local community.
“We explain at Year 6 open evenings that we teach EBacc subjects and expect pupils to take them as GCSEs because it opens up their future options and the possibility of university”
The County High School
-	North West school who moved from Ofsted Good rating in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 13% in 2011 to 82.6% in 2017
The school believes that pupils are going out into a highly competitive environment and so it is their role to prepare children for this future. When EBacc was announced they thought it would be appropriate for all of their students as many were already doing core subjects plus one or two of the other EBacc subjects and so it would be useful for them to have studied the whole set of EBacc subjects.
The school has a progress mentality with an embedded culture of meeting targets. All students are set challenging targets per subject with the expectation that they and their teachers will do all they can to meet these. Targets are set using the Fischer Family Trust 20% measures, so they are high but not unachievable. This method gives precise targets reflecting the subject difficulty.
Students failing to meet targets have interventions within or after school (to re-cover lessons and try different delivery styles, with all sessions double staffed with class teachers and an LSA) to support them to achieve.
West Lakes Academy
-	Rural school moved from Ofsted rating of Good in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 7.1% in 2011 to 65.8% in 2017
Their philosophy is based on ‘World Class Outcomes’ from EPI http://www.epi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/English-education-world-class.pdf 
This set a benchmark of 80% of students getting 50 Attainment 8 points. They break this down as being Grade 5 in 8 subjects and have this as a cross-school target.</p>

<p>Getting parents ‘on board’
Schools focussed on getting parents on board with the concept of the study of EBacc subjects. This was to explain the approach to them, engage them, and encourage them to support their children’s choices, in the study of EBacc subjects, but also to better equip them to support their children and reinforce the high aspirations the school were promoting. They were doing this through a range of parent engagement and information-sharing activities, including:
•	introducing the schools’ approach to EBacc subjects from Year 6 open evenings. In this way it was just presented as part of the school. 
•	promoting the EBacc subjects, and the reason why they encouraged students to study them, at parents’ evenings and especially at options events (just before students select their subjects for KS4 study).
Examples of parent information events
Woodkirk Academy
-	School in Yorkshire with 303 pupils at KS4
-	18.2% of pupils are from disadvantaged backgrounds
They hold a parents information-giving evening for parents of all Year 7 and Year 8 pupils. All subjects which are studied are covered, but they have an especially big push on the importance and value of MFL. This emphasis on MFL permeates through everything they do with pupils and parents, constantly reinforcing the message of the importance the school places on it.
Sandy Upper School
-	School in the East of England with 79.1% Ebacc entry rates
-	Improved Ofsted rating from Inadequate in 2014 to Good in 2017
At an open evening for parents of year 8 pupils they present their EBacc curriculum model (i.e. all students studying all EBacc subjects through to GCSE level) as the schools’ approach and integral to the way they teach. Taking EBacc subjects is not optional and that is part of the school ethos. They sell this approach to parents as they believe studying these subjects leads to success. Parents support this approach, as opposed to an open choices options model, and respect the fact the school has set it up in a way that means students study EBacc subjects without jeopardising the study of any other subjects (i.e. they have other free option blocks).
Woodchurch High School
-	275 pupils at KS4, with 44.7% from disadvantaged backgrounds and a fifth eligible for FSM
-	EBacc entry rates at 62.5%
They have a comprehensive parent engagement programme, including:
-	In the first term they have after-school curriculum evenings, including taster sessions of MFL lessons.
-	Pre-KS4 options they have another parents evening, again including lesson sampling.
-	On Options day parents are invited in to meet staff and look at course materials.
-	A ‘take your parents to school’ day.
-	A Parents’ Academy where parents (including those of pupils in receipt of Pupil Premium funding) can sample lessons and are engaged in practical activities. 
This all builds trust and involvement in the school and results in little resistance to their approach to studying EBacc subjects.</p>

<p>Examples of parental support events
Chorlton High School
-	Manchester school with 291 pupils at KS4
-	38.8% of pupils are from disadvantaged backgrounds
-	EBacc entry rates at 59.1%
They run a series of parent events in the evening, to up-skill and inform parents, as well as encouraging links between school and home. The most popular event is ‘How we teach English and Maths in years 7-9’ with over 100 attendees. Academic topics as event themes result in more parental interest and engagement. A school mentor calls home to directly target and invite the parents of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend.
 
Securing staffing
Schools saw dynamic, enthgusiastic teaching staff as crucial to the success of implementing their approach to EBacc subjects. They detailed some of the successful strategies they had used for staff recruitment and retention (because if you get good staff, you need to keep them). These included:
•	Using the Visiting teacher programme
•	Using recruitment companies
•	Growing your own – especially if a SCITT, or part of a school alliance
•	Retraining staff – from those specialising in non-EBacc subjects to EBacc subjects
•	Pay – offering increased pay and/or incentivising additionality (such as for CPD, enrichment) 
•	Training – offering CPD as an effective way to show value for, and therefore retain, quality staff as well as a means of upskilling.
Examples of using the Visiting teacher programme
Denbigh School
-	Milton Keynes school with201 pupils at KS4
-	MFL entry rates 61.7%
They recruited 2 teachers through the Spanish visiting teacher programme https://www.gov.uk/guidance/spains-visiting-teachers-programme#whats-involved Having interviewed around 30 candidates in Madrid. They believe these staff have introduced freshness and ideas. As fluent language users they are better able to make vocabulary and grammar engaging. They bring a different approach – such as their use of technology and use of white boards. There are some issues with classroom management but they provide extra training and support for them. They run training on behaviour management, the tutor role from their NQT sessions. They also provide mentors and do more observations with them. They believe “you get out of them what you put in”.</p>

<p>Examples of using recruitment companies
George Dixon Academy
-	Birmingham school where 68.3% of pupils have EAL
-	EBacc entry rate 72%
This school was finding it hard to recruit sufficient numbers and quality of teaching staff in all of the EBacc subjects. They tried advertising posts but had a very poor response and did not find candidates of sufficient quality to offer full-time contracts to. They found using a specialist recruitment company,TeachIn, led to much greater success, and enabled them to recruit suitable staff to their school.

Other schools reported partnering with TeachFirst to ensure a supply of NQTs who they could mould into the schools approach.

<p>Examples of retraining staff in EBacc subjects
The County High School
-	EBacc entry rate increased from 13% in 2011 to 82.6% in 2017
-	Improved Ofsted rating from Good in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017
The switch to offering EBacc subjects to a greater number of students meant they needed more staff in Humanities and MFL. Some staff who were specialists in non-EBacc subjects retrained to be able to deliver EBacc subjects, including a DT teacher who retrained in History.
Making previously optional subjects into core subjects has led to increased class sizes and a wider range of pupils studying them which has changed teaching requirements (some teachers liked teaching smaller groups of pupils who had elected to study their subjects) and so the school is also addressing teaching methods and Department leadership structures.
Ensuring progression routes
Schools were aware that if they were encouraging students to study EBacc subjects to GCSE level, and identifying this as a route into further education and university they needed to ensure there were good local progression routes for studying these subjects to A-Level. 
They had identified that more students taking these particular subjects to GCSE level is likely to lead to increased demand in EBacc subjects at A-Level. 
Schools had therefore:
•	Linked with local colleges and Sixth Form providers to make sure they offer A-Level routes in EBacc subjects.
•	Developed their own Sixth Form offer in EBacc subjects and worked to prepare pupils to take these subjects on to A Level.
Examples of linking with 6th form providers
The County High School
-	EBacc entry rate increased from 13% in 2011 to 82.6% in 2017
-	Improved Ofsted rating from Good in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017
The school has no Sixth Form. 60% of their Year 11 students go on to a Sixth Form college and the others to FE colleges locally. The school have worked with their college partners to keep them up to date on their curriculum changes. The shift to the EBacc approach meant local colleges had to be prepared for offering suitable progression routes and increased take up in EBacc subjects.
The Marches School
-	Shropshire academy with 220 pupils at KS4
-	Increased EBacc entry rates from 13.3% in 2011 to 68.6% in 2017
They looked at local post-16 options and realised there was not a good level of provision to continue studying EBacc subjects to A-Level. This seemed a shame for students wanting to pursue these more academic subjects, and stand a chance of going on to study them at University. They therefore set up their own Sixth Form to ensure high quality delivery of post-16 study in all of the EBacc subjects.</p>

<p>Reflecting and developing
Implementing these strategies was not a one-off process. Schools had implemented various strategies over time but were then continually reflecting on their impact and success, tweaking their approach and delivery further, or going on to try new, or develop further, approaches.
The journey to increased take up rates had often developed over time – maybe 4 years or more – and the increase in achievement rates was often described as lagging somewhat behind that.
Schools were using Student Voice to gather feedback and suggest changes to approach and future development.
Examples of reflecting and developing
Longdendale High School
-	Improved Ofsted rating from Requires Improvement in 2014 to Good in 2017
-	MFL Entry rates 83.6%
As part of a curriculum review of all EBacc subjects they carried out a Student Voice exercise. This identified, for example, that students are very positive about MFL and using target language in those lessons, explaining it as being normal practice in those classrooms. This reassured staff about their chosen approach.</p>

<h3 id="aims-and-methodology">Aims and methodology</h3>

<p>This research aimed to: 
•	Learn from those who have made good progress (evidenced by an increase of over 40% in entry rates over the previous five years) towards achieving the government’s targets 
•	Understand what these schools have done; 
•	Share what schools making good progress in terms of their entry rates have done (including by exemplifying barriers faced and solutions used to address them); 
•	Produce an output that can provide practical, real-world examples of strategies that could be used by schools that have below average EBacc entry to help them achieve the government’s EBacc entry ambition.</p>

<p>As such, barriers facing those schools that had not increased their EBacc entry by 40 per cent in the last five years were to be explored and the output produced was to be tested for suitability with these potential users.
The methodology involved:
Stage 1 – Scoping with schools not achieving the target
Six interviews with school leaders of schools who had not increased their entry rates by 40 per cent in the last five years. The aim of these interviews was to explore what barriers these schools were facing in achieving the target, what advice and practical detail they would like to receive from schools reaching the target and what type of output they would find most useful to guide their future improvement.
Stage 2 – Mainstage interviews with schools that have improved their EBacc entry rates by at least 40% over the last 5 years
Thirty interviews with school leaders in schools who had shown increases of 40% or more in the last few years of pupils entering EBacc subjects. 
The criteria for this sample of schools was:
•	Increased their EBacc entry rates by at least 40% at some point between 2010 and 2017
•	Performed at least 10% better than expected (based on their cohort) in 2015, 2016, 2017
•	Had a current good or outstanding ofsted rating
•	Positive progress 8 score. 
Additional sample was provided which met the same criteria, except without a positive Progress 8 score.
This resulted in a sample of 112 secondary schools in the main sample and 19 additional schools.
The aim of the mainstage interviews was to: explore what strategies these schools had employed to improve their entry rates; provide detail of how they had implemented these, including how any issues faced were overcome; and to try and address some of the issues raised by schools not reaching the target (from Stage 1) by asking schools who had made progress what solutions they had provided if applicable to those raised by schools during the scoping phase. 
Stage 3 – development of output
The make-up of the six schools included in the Scoping phase (stage 1) were:
	Ofsted rating	Region	Current % of pupils entered for EBacc subjects (entry rate)	EBacc attainment	Other features
1	2	North West	31%	20%	Single sex - Boys
2	2	North East	18%	8%	Area of very high deprivation
3	2	East	10%	5%	Coastal and high deprivation
4	2	Inner London	43%	28%	Well above average Progress 8
5	2 (from 3)	South East	32%	16%	Selective area
6	2	Yorks &amp; H	42%	22%	High EBacc entry area</p>

<p>Interviews conducted with schools in the scoping phase revealed that:
•	Staffing and recruitment is an issue – especially for MFL
•	Lack of interest in MFL – especially boys
•	Lack of relevance of EBacc subjects
•	Don’t feel it is their job to determine careers by forcing choices into EBacc subjects over others
•	EBacc is not a qualification with any currency – it’s a performance measure/target (and not compulsory)
•	Why support EBacc when doesn’t help with progress 8. Progress 8 (and inclusion of 3 EBacc subjects) better measure
•	SEND/low ability struggle – what should schools do? Disapply SEND? If not, how timetable and allow SEND to do more maths and English?
•	Depends on links with primary schools and often what MFL they have/are doing
•	Reliance on foreign teachers to teach foreign language who do not necessarily enthuse pupils 
•	Mismatch between how English is taught and MFL
•	EBacc subjects are exam heavy, so deterrent as option</p>

<p>There was a perception that others meet the target by:
•	Entry at expense of achievement or lack of broad and balanced curriculum tailored to pupils needs/wants and career choices
•	Achieving MFL by entering students for exams in home language e.g. where high proportions of BME, diversity of first language
•	Use of I-GCSEs / non-taught qualifications
•	Operating different models from which students select their GCSE options
•	Disapplying less academically able students
•	Being in selective/more affluent areas
•	Being in London (with different context)</p>

<p>Stakeholders told us they wanted to know or wanted help with:
•	Meeting the target in an appropriate way:
•	How to encourage take up of academic subjects? How not to disengage from learning?
•	How to set up options to allow holistic curriculum?
•	How to deliver subjects/curriculum in an engaging way – e.g. like history at primary/KS3 then don’t like at GCSE? Making maths accessible
•	How not to set pupils up to fail (i.e. entering and achieving) 
•	Can EBacc subjects be delivered in a way that is ‘job appropriate’?
•	How to allow time for additional support in E&amp;M? How to overcome E&amp;M issues in other subjects?
•	How recruiting good quality staff?
•	MFL:
•	How delivering MFL and recruiting good, motivating teachers?
•	How to make MFL relevant for life and job prospects?
•	How meeting MFL target when don’t have students with MFL home language?
•	Whether way to link English and MFL teaching?
•	Preparation and progression
•	How do primary feeders support skill build up?
•	What is being provided as a base at KS3?
•	How are they supporting choices appropriate for post-16 study?
•	What is the longer-term journey to achieving target? Steps to success?</p>

<p>The key issues these scoping interviews raised for the mainstage interviews with schools meeting the target and what we wanted to learn from them were:
•	School context is key – want to learn from similar settings (e.g. socio demographics)
•	London context is different (population; recruitment) – need examples from outside London
•	Cautious about gaining examples of good practice (in terms of high entry results) when they are not evidencing good (achievement) outcomes
•	MFL is a key focus
•	Seems to be an effect of area

Some of the cohort with SEND are also deemed gifted and talented. The only barrier to access to studying the whole range of EBacc subjects is low levels of English and Maths skills. Those students are given more literacy support instead of MFL as if they cannot understand the rules of their own language they are seen as unlikely to be able to learn or apply it to another. Teachers work closely with the SENCO on in-class strategies to support the learning of pupils with SEND.

At the same time as these strategies were being implemented school leaders were bringing about a cultural shift. This was across the whole school and all subjects, but it especially underpinned the success of their approach to EBacc subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe changes brought about were:\n•\tHaving high aspirations\n•\tGetting parents on board\n•\tSecuring staffing\n•\tEnsuring progression routes\n•\tReflecting and developing \nHaving high aspirations\nSchools acknowledged that EBacc subjects can be more academically challenging for some pupils. However, by encouraging pupils to take EBacc subjects they felt they were sending out the message ‘we believe in you and we believe that you have the ability to succeed at this’. Taking EBacc subjects was often linked to helping pupils achieve the best in their future – securing a good career or going to university.\nEncouraging the study of EBacc subjects as part of this ‘aiming high’ approach was to: \n•\tshow students are academically able\n•\tpromote higher level thinking \n•\tsupport and show the benefit of perseverance with a difficult subject \n•\tassist disadvantaged pupils’ social mobility\n•\tbenefit the whole child and their holistic, rounded knowledge and development. \nThe schools’ approach to high aspirations was: \n•\tled from the top and permeated through the school, being reinforced by all teachers and in a range of lessons\n•\treflected in school mottos and mission statements, and in contact with parents and the wider community\n•\treinforced through the CIAG programme and focus on pupils’ future pathways\n•\tsupported by ambitious target setting.\nExamples of the high aspiration approach\nWitton Park Academy\n-\tBlackburn school with 38.1% of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 2.9% in 2011 to 50.6% in 2016\nThe school considered removing French as a compulsory subject as students found it difficult to engage with. However they decided that this would be sending out the message that they do not have high expectations for their pupils. They continued to make it compulsory reinforcing it with the message that ‘we know it’s hard, but we believe in you’. They have a similar approach with encouraging students to study separate sciences.\nOptions pathways are explained to parents at Options Evening. The staff are clear – EBacc is for their child’s future benefit. It helps to keep their future options open. Some universities will require EBacc subject passes, and although the school cannot predict where the child will want to go it is the ‘safety first’ option. They advise pupils based on their honest belief that for most of them studying EBacc subjects will be the best option.\nGeorge Dixon Academy\n-\tBirmingham school with 65.3% of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 2.3% in 2011 to 72% in 2017\nIn 2010, following the Wolf report, they overhauled the curriculum to provide access to EBacc for all students. This called for a shift in mind-set of staff and those connected with the school. They believed that report called on schools to ignore pupils’ disadvantage and set high standards for all. Students are all expected to study EBacc subjects through to GCSE level and a third of students are now encouraged to do triple sciences. The school sees themselves as applying pressure, in terms of setting such high expectations, for a valuable purpose. \nThey believe that getting students to study EBacc subjects provides stretch and challenge and allows the possibility of going to university. They explain to pupils that certain subjects are key in life and the EBacc pathway includes these. They believe that by not pushing children to study these subjects they would be continuing the disadvantage that many of them face due to their family circumstances.  The Head believes that educators have the power to change lives, and give poorer children the options to get out of that negative cycle. Studying EBacc subjects is seen as offering the bedrock for their future. They talk to all students about their future options, and how Universities will look at GCSE results when making decisions about who to accept. They reinforce how important they think it is for students to be able to show broad and wanted skills and that by taking EBacc subjects more doors will be open to them.\nDenbigh School\n-\tMilton Keynes school rated Outstanding\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 29.1% in 2011 to 77.6% in 2016\nStudying MFL is presented as part of the school, and a part of the school’s core offer. They believe in the students, and their ability to succeed, and believe in perseverance. They promote the compulsory study of a MFL subject as showing that students cannot give up on something just because they might find it difficult.\nLongdendale High School\n-\tCommunity school in the North West\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 22% in 2011 to 76.4% in 2017\n-\tIncreased Ofsted rating from Requires Improvement in 2014 to Good in 2017\nThey use their Inspiring IAG programme (http://www.inspiringiag.co.uk) to keep students switched on to studying EBacc subjects. The school is committed to providing high quality careers education, information, advice and guidance to every student. They have a sharp focus on careers guidance being tailored to the needs of the individual student to promote self-awareness, decision-making, employability skills, and independence whilst raising aspirations. Their aim is for all students to leave school equipped with the skills and knowledge required to support their entry into further education or employment. All young people receive a planned programme of activities to help them choose 14-19 pathways that are suitable for them and to be able to manage their careers and sustain employability throughout their lives.\nBranston Community Academy\n-\tRural school in Lincoln rated outstanding\n-\tEBacc entry rates increased from 7.1% in 2011 to 50.3% in 2016\n-\t42.6% achievement rate\nThis school encourages students into studying the EBacc subjects by highlighting the Government’s push for this. They present EBacc subjects as those that the Government says are important and thinks that all students are bright enough to study and so they support pupils to study them. The school also discuss University entrance with pupils, and the importance of having EBacc subjects to GCSE level. \nMounts Bay Academy\n-\tSituated in Penzance with a fifth of students from a disadvantaged background\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 27.4% in 2011 to 76.1% in 2016\n-\tRated outstanding by Ofsted\nThey have found the Government introduction of the EBacc helpful, as they explain to pupils that the school are not just making them do those subjects for arbitrary reasons but that the Government thinks this is the right thing for them to do, that it broadens their horizons, that Universities value EBacc subjects when looking for students to offer places to, and that it is good for the economy and local community.\n“We explain at Year 6 open evenings that we teach EBacc subjects and expect pupils to take them as GCSEs because it opens up their future options and the possibility of university”\nThe County High School\n-\tNorth West school who moved from Ofsted Good rating in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 13% in 2011 to 82.6% in 2017\nThe school believes that pupils are going out into a highly competitive environment and so it is their role to prepare children for this future. When EBacc was announced they thought it would be appropriate for all of their students as many were already doing core subjects plus one or two of the other EBacc subjects and so it would be useful for them to have studied the whole set of EBacc subjects.\nThe school has a progress mentality with an embedded culture of meeting targets. All students are set challenging targets per subject with the expectation that they and their teachers will do all they can to meet these. Targets are set using the Fischer Family Trust 20% measures, so they are high but not unachievable. This method gives precise targets reflecting the subject difficulty.\nStudents failing to meet targets have interventions within or after school (to re-cover lessons and try different delivery styles, with all sessions double staffed with class teachers and an LSA) to support them to achieve.\nWest Lakes Academy\n-\tRural school moved from Ofsted rating of Good in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 7.1% in 2011 to 65.8% in 2017\nTheir philosophy is based on ‘World Class Outcomes’ from EPI http://www.epi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/English-education-world-class.pdf \nThis set a benchmark of 80% of students getting 50 Attainment 8 points. They break this down as being Grade 5 in 8 subjects and have this as a cross-school target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGetting parents ‘on board’\nSchools focussed on getting parents on board with the concept of the study of EBacc subjects. This was to explain the approach to them, engage them, and encourage them to support their children’s choices, in the study of EBacc subjects, but also to better equip them to support their children and reinforce the high aspirations the school were promoting. They were doing this through a range of parent engagement and information-sharing activities, including:\n•\tintroducing the schools’ approach to EBacc subjects from Year 6 open evenings. In this way it was just presented as part of the school. \n•\tpromoting the EBacc subjects, and the reason why they encouraged students to study them, at parents’ evenings and especially at options events (just before students select their subjects for KS4 study).\nExamples of parent information events\nWoodkirk Academy\n-\tSchool in Yorkshire with 303 pupils at KS4\n-\t18.2% of pupils are from disadvantaged backgrounds\nThey hold a parents information-giving evening for parents of all Year 7 and Year 8 pupils. All subjects which are studied are covered, but they have an especially big push on the importance and value of MFL. This emphasis on MFL permeates through everything they do with pupils and parents, constantly reinforcing the message of the importance the school places on it.\nSandy Upper School\n-\tSchool in the East of England with 79.1% Ebacc entry rates\n-\tImproved Ofsted rating from Inadequate in 2014 to Good in 2017\nAt an open evening for parents of year 8 pupils they present their EBacc curriculum model (i.e. all students studying all EBacc subjects through to GCSE level) as the schools’ approach and integral to the way they teach. Taking EBacc subjects is not optional and that is part of the school ethos. They sell this approach to parents as they believe studying these subjects leads to success. Parents support this approach, as opposed to an open choices options model, and respect the fact the school has set it up in a way that means students study EBacc subjects without jeopardising the study of any other subjects (i.e. they have other free option blocks).\nWoodchurch High School\n-\t275 pupils at KS4, with 44.7% from disadvantaged backgrounds and a fifth eligible for FSM\n-\tEBacc entry rates at 62.5%\nThey have a comprehensive parent engagement programme, including:\n-\tIn the first term they have after-school curriculum evenings, including taster sessions of MFL lessons.\n-\tPre-KS4 options they have another parents evening, again including lesson sampling.\n-\tOn Options day parents are invited in to meet staff and look at course materials.\n-\tA ‘take your parents to school’ day.\n-\tA Parents’ Academy where parents (including those of pupils in receipt of Pupil Premium funding) can sample lessons and are engaged in practical activities. \nThis all builds trust and involvement in the school and results in little resistance to their approach to studying EBacc subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of parental support events\nChorlton High School\n-\tManchester school with 291 pupils at KS4\n-\t38.8% of pupils are from disadvantaged backgrounds\n-\tEBacc entry rates at 59.1%\nThey run a series of parent events in the evening, to up-skill and inform parents, as well as encouraging links between school and home. The most popular event is ‘How we teach English and Maths in years 7-9’ with over 100 attendees. Academic topics as event themes result in more parental interest and engagement. A school mentor calls home to directly target and invite the parents of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend.\n \nSecuring staffing\nSchools saw dynamic, enthgusiastic teaching staff as crucial to the success of implementing their approach to EBacc subjects. They detailed some of the successful strategies they had used for staff recruitment and retention (because if you get good staff, you need to keep them). These included:\n•\tUsing the Visiting teacher programme\n•\tUsing recruitment companies\n•\tGrowing your own – especially if a SCITT, or part of a school alliance\n•\tRetraining staff – from those specialising in non-EBacc subjects to EBacc subjects\n•\tPay – offering increased pay and/or incentivising additionality (such as for CPD, enrichment) \n•\tTraining – offering CPD as an effective way to show value for, and therefore retain, quality staff as well as a means of upskilling.\nExamples of using the Visiting teacher programme\nDenbigh School\n-\tMilton Keynes school with201 pupils at KS4\n-\tMFL entry rates 61.7%\nThey recruited 2 teachers through the Spanish visiting teacher programme https://www.gov.uk/guidance/spains-visiting-teachers-programme#whats-involved Having interviewed around 30 candidates in Madrid. They believe these staff have introduced freshness and ideas. As fluent language users they are better able to make vocabulary and grammar engaging. They bring a different approach – such as their use of technology and use of white boards. There are some issues with classroom management but they provide extra training and support for them. They run training on behaviour management, the tutor role from their NQT sessions. They also provide mentors and do more observations with them. They believe “you get out of them what you put in”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of using recruitment companies\nGeorge Dixon Academy\n-\tBirmingham school where 68.3% of pupils have EAL\n-\tEBacc entry rate 72%\nThis school was finding it hard to recruit sufficient numbers and quality of teaching staff in all of the EBacc subjects. They tried advertising posts but had a very poor response and did not find candidates of sufficient quality to offer full-time contracts to. They found using a specialist recruitment company,TeachIn, led to much greater success, and enabled them to recruit suitable staff to their school.\nhttp://www.teachin.co.uk\nOther schools reported partnering with TeachFirst to ensure a supply of NQTs who they could mould into the schools approach.\nhttps://www.teachfirst.org.uk/schools\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExamples of retraining staff in EBacc subjects\nThe County High School\n-\tEBacc entry rate increased from 13% in 2011 to 82.6% in 2017\n-\tImproved Ofsted rating from Good in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017\nThe switch to offering EBacc subjects to a greater number of students meant they needed more staff in Humanities and MFL. Some staff who were specialists in non-EBacc subjects retrained to be able to deliver EBacc subjects, including a DT teacher who retrained in History.\nMaking previously optional subjects into core subjects has led to increased class sizes and a wider range of pupils studying them which has changed teaching requirements (some teachers liked teaching smaller groups of pupils who had elected to study their subjects) and so the school is also addressing teaching methods and Department leadership structures.\nEnsuring progression routes\nSchools were aware that if they were encouraging students to study EBacc subjects to GCSE level, and identifying this as a route into further education and university they needed to ensure there were good local progression routes for studying these subjects to A-Level. \nThey had identified that more students taking these particular subjects to GCSE level is likely to lead to increased demand in EBacc subjects at A-Level. \nSchools had therefore:\n•\tLinked with local colleges and Sixth Form providers to make sure they offer A-Level routes in EBacc subjects.\n•\tDeveloped their own Sixth Form offer in EBacc subjects and worked to prepare pupils to take these subjects on to A Level.\nExamples of linking with 6th form providers\nThe County High School\n-\tEBacc entry rate increased from 13% in 2011 to 82.6% in 2017\n-\tImproved Ofsted rating from Good in 2014 to Outstanding in 2017\nThe school has no Sixth Form. 60% of their Year 11 students go on to a Sixth Form college and the others to FE colleges locally. The school have worked with their college partners to keep them up to date on their curriculum changes. The shift to the EBacc approach meant local colleges had to be prepared for offering suitable progression routes and increased take up in EBacc subjects.\nThe Marches School\n-\tShropshire academy with 220 pupils at KS4\n-\tIncreased EBacc entry rates from 13.3% in 2011 to 68.6% in 2017\nThey looked at local post-16 options and realised there was not a good level of provision to continue studying EBacc subjects to A-Level. This seemed a shame for students wanting to pursue these more academic subjects, and stand a chance of going on to study them at University. They therefore set up their own Sixth Form to ensure high quality delivery of post-16 study in all of the EBacc subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReflecting and developing\nImplementing these strategies was not a one-off process. Schools had implemented various strategies over time but were then continually reflecting on their impact and success, tweaking their approach and delivery further, or going on to try new, or develop further, approaches.\nThe journey to increased take up rates had often developed over time – maybe 4 years or more – and the increase in achievement rates was often described as lagging somewhat behind that.\nSchools were using Student Voice to gather feedback and suggest changes to approach and future development.\nExamples of reflecting and developing\nLongdendale High School\n-\tImproved Ofsted rating from Requires Improvement in 2014 to Good in 2017\n-\tMFL Entry rates 83.6%\nAs part of a curriculum review of all EBacc subjects they carried out a Student Voice exercise. This identified, for example, that students are very positive about MFL and using target language in those lessons, explaining it as being normal practice in those classrooms. This reassured staff about their chosen approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appendices\"\u003eAppendices\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"aims-and-methodology\"\u003eAims and methodology\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis research aimed to: \n•\tLearn from those who have made good progress (evidenced by an increase of over 40% in entry rates over the previous five years) towards achieving the government’s targets \n•\tUnderstand what these schools have done; \n•\tShare what schools making good progress in terms of their entry rates have done (including by exemplifying barriers faced and solutions used to address them); \n•\tProduce an output that can provide practical, real-world examples of strategies that could be used by schools that have below average EBacc entry to help them achieve the government’s EBacc entry ambition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, barriers facing those schools that had not increased their EBacc entry by 40 per cent in the last five years were to be explored and the output produced was to be tested for suitability with these potential users.\nThe methodology involved:\nStage 1 – Scoping with schools not achieving the target\nSix interviews with school leaders of schools who had not increased their entry rates by 40 per cent in the last five years. The aim of these interviews was to explore what barriers these schools were facing in achieving the target, what advice and practical detail they would like to receive from schools reaching the target and what type of output they would find most useful to guide their future improvement.\nStage 2 – Mainstage interviews with schools that have improved their EBacc entry rates by at least 40% over the last 5 years\nThirty interviews with school leaders in schools who had shown increases of 40% or more in the last few years of pupils entering EBacc subjects. \nThe criteria for this sample of schools was:\n•\tIncreased their EBacc entry rates by at least 40% at some point between 2010 and 2017\n•\tPerformed at least 10% better than expected (based on their cohort) in 2015, 2016, 2017\n•\tHad a current good or outstanding ofsted rating\n•\tPositive progress 8 score. \nAdditional sample was provided which met the same criteria, except without a positive Progress 8 score.\nThis resulted in a sample of 112 secondary schools in the main sample and 19 additional schools.\nThe aim of the mainstage interviews was to: explore what strategies these schools had employed to improve their entry rates; provide detail of how they had implemented these, including how any issues faced were overcome; and to try and address some of the issues raised by schools not reaching the target (from Stage 1) by asking schools who had made progress what solutions they had provided if applicable to those raised by schools during the scoping phase. \nStage 3 – development of output\nThe make-up of the six schools included in the Scoping phase (stage 1) were:\n\tOfsted rating\tRegion\tCurrent % of pupils entered for EBacc subjects (entry rate)\tEBacc attainment\tOther features\n1\t2\tNorth West\t31%\t20%\tSingle sex - Boys\n2\t2\tNorth East\t18%\t8%\tArea of very high deprivation\n3\t2\tEast\t10%\t5%\tCoastal and high deprivation\n4\t2\tInner London\t43%\t28%\tWell above average Progress 8\n5\t2 (from 3)\tSouth East\t32%\t16%\tSelective area\n6\t2\tYorks \u0026amp; H\t42%\t22%\tHigh EBacc entry area\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterviews conducted with schools in the scoping phase revealed that:\n•\tStaffing and recruitment is an issue – especially for MFL\n•\tLack of interest in MFL – especially boys\n•\tLack of relevance of EBacc subjects\n•\tDon’t feel it is their job to determine careers by forcing choices into EBacc subjects over others\n•\tEBacc is not a qualification with any currency – it’s a performance measure/target (and not compulsory)\n•\tWhy support EBacc when doesn’t help with progress 8. Progress 8 (and inclusion of 3 EBacc subjects) better measure\n•\tSEND/low ability struggle – what should schools do? Disapply SEND? If not, how timetable and allow SEND to do more maths and English?\n•\tDepends on links with primary schools and often what MFL they have/are doing\n•\tReliance on foreign teachers to teach foreign language who do not necessarily enthuse pupils \n•\tMismatch between how English is taught and MFL\n•\tEBacc subjects are exam heavy, so deterrent as option\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a perception that others meet the target by:\n•\tEntry at expense of achievement or lack of broad and balanced curriculum tailored to pupils needs/wants and career choices\n•\tAchieving MFL by entering students for exams in home language e.g. where high proportions of BME, diversity of first language\n•\tUse of I-GCSEs / non-taught qualifications\n•\tOperating different models from which students select their GCSE options\n•\tDisapplying less academically able students\n•\tBeing in selective/more affluent areas\n•\tBeing in London (with different context)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStakeholders told us they wanted to know or wanted help with:\n•\tMeeting the target in an appropriate way:\n•\tHow to encourage take up of academic subjects? How not to disengage from learning?\n•\tHow to set up options to allow holistic curriculum?\n•\tHow to deliver subjects/curriculum in an engaging way – e.g. like history at primary/KS3 then don’t like at GCSE? Making maths accessible\n•\tHow not to set pupils up to fail (i.e. entering and achieving) \n•\tCan EBacc subjects be delivered in a way that is ‘job appropriate’?\n•\tHow to allow time for additional support in E\u0026amp;M? How to overcome E\u0026amp;M issues in other subjects?\n•\tHow recruiting good quality staff?\n•\tMFL:\n•\tHow delivering MFL and recruiting good, motivating teachers?\n•\tHow to make MFL relevant for life and job prospects?\n•\tHow meeting MFL target when don’t have students with MFL home language?\n•\tWhether way to link English and MFL teaching?\n•\tPreparation and progression\n•\tHow do primary feeders support skill build up?\n•\tWhat is being provided as a base at KS3?\n•\tHow are they supporting choices appropriate for post-16 study?\n•\tWhat is the longer-term journey to achieving target? Steps to success?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe key issues these scoping interviews raised for the mainstage interviews with schools meeting the target and what we wanted to learn from them were:\n•\tSchool context is key – want to learn from similar settings (e.g. socio demographics)\n•\tLondon context is different (population; recruitment) – need examples from outside London\n•\tCautious about gaining examples of good practice (in terms of high entry results) when they are not evidencing good (achievement) outcomes\n•\tMFL is a key focus\n•\tSeems to be an effect of area\nSample school characteristics\nThe characteristics of the 30 schools consulted for the depth interviews on their improvement practice were wide ranging, reflecting a range of different circumstances and cohorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNumbers of schools in achieved sample (n=30) by characteristics\nSchool type\tAcademy – sponsor led\tAcademy - convertor\tfoundation\tcommunity\tVoluntary aided\n#\t4\t16\t3\t5\t2\nPupils at KS4\t134-150\t151-180\t181-200\t201-250\t251-303\n#\t5\t12\t4\t4\t5\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFSM\t1.7-5\t5.1-10\t10.1-16\t17.8-20\t20.1-25.3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"section\"\u003e6\t10\t5\t4\t5\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisadvantage\t5.6-10\t10.1-20\t20.1-25\t25.1-45\t45.1-65.3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"section-1\"\u003e3\t9\t6\t9\t3\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegion\tSW\tSE\tOuter London\tInner London\tEast\n#\t1\t3\t3\t3\t2\nRegion\tWMids\tEMids\tYorks \u0026amp;H\tNW\t\n#\t3\t3\t6\t6\t\nUrban/rural\tRural town\tUrban City\tUrban major conurbation\t\t\n#\t5\t9\t16\t\t\nOfsted rating\tOutstanding\tGood\tImproved rating between 2014-2017\t\t\n#\t14\t16\t4\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2011 EBacc Entry rates\t0-10\t11-20\t21-30\t31-60\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"section-2\"\u003e12\t6\t7\t5\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2017 EBacc Entry rates\t44-60\t60.1-70\t70.1-80\t80.1-96.6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"note--some-had-increased-rates-then-reduced-since-201168511\"\u003e(note – some had increased rates then reduced since 2011)\t6\t8\t5\t11\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAchievement rates 2017\t6.9-20\t21-30\t31-40\t41-50\t51-82.7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"section-3\"\u003e3\t9\t9\t7\t2\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEAL\tConfirm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver 20% = 4\t\t\t\t\n#\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEN\tConfirm.
